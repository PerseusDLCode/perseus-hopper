(ns perseus-morph.lexica.xml-parser
  "Parser for TEI dictionary XML (entry/entryFree elements containing sense
   children), ported from perseus.voting.SenseLoader$SenseLoaderHandler.
   Unlike that SAX handler (and this namespace's own earlier SAX-based
   version), this parses the whole file into a tree via clojure.xml/parse
   and walks it with a zipper -- these lexicon files aren't large enough to
   need streaming, and a tree lets sense extraction handle *nested* <sense>
   elements correctly (a sense's own text, separate from any sub-senses'),
   where a single-pass SAX handler with no element stack could only
   conflate them. (clojure.xml/parse drops whitespace-only text nodes
   between sibling elements, so reconstructed entry text won't always have
   the exact whitespace the source did -- acceptable here.)

   `parse-lexicon!` invokes `on-sense` once per <sense>, anywhere in an
   entry's subtree, with {:key :id :n :level :short-def}, where :key is the
   enclosing entry's `key` attribute and :short-def is that sense's *own*
   text (tr/gloss/hi children wrapped in `meaning-tag`; nested sub-senses'
   text excluded, since those get their own on-sense calls), or
   \"[no specified meaning]\" if the sense has no text of its own. It also
   invokes `on-entry` once per entry, anywhere in the document, with
   {:key :text}, where :text is a serialization of the entry's full
   subtree (every descendant tag, attribute, and text node) -- captured
   independently of on-sense, so the whole entry is available for display
   without re-reading the source XML at request time."

# new-morpheus

HTTP API for morphological lookups, reading from `morph.db` (the SQLite
database produced by the Clojure ingestion pipeline in `../clojure`).

## Setup

Requires the `morph.db` file to exist at `../clojure/morph.db` (run the
Clojure ingestion pipeline first if it doesn't), migrated to the current
schema (`clj -M -m perseus-morph.migrations` or any code path that calls
`perseus-morph.migrations/migrate!`) and
with lexica ingested via `clj -M:ingest` so the `senses`/`entries` tables
backing `senses`/`entries` in the API response are populated.

```sh
uv sync
```

## Running

Dev server (autoreload, binds to `127.0.0.1`):

```sh
uv run new-morpheus-dev
```

Production server (binds to `0.0.0.0`, multiple workers):

```sh
uv run new-morpheus
```

Both respect `PORT` (default `8000`); the production server also respects
`WEB_CONCURRENCY` (default `4`) for worker count.

## Tests

```sh
uv run pytest
```

## API

`GET /morph?word=<word>&language=<language_code>&document_id=<optional>&prior_word=<optional>`

Returns the candidate lemmas and parses for `word`. `word` must be in beta
code (the encoding `parses.form` is stored in), not Unicode -- e.g. `mh=nin`
for `μῆνιν`. Each lemma includes its `senses` (short, per-sense glosses from
the ingested lexicon, e.g. LSJ for Greek) and `entries` (the full text of
that lexicon's whole dictionary article for the lemma, so the UI doesn't
need to re-read the source XML for a complete view). If `document_id` is
given, each lemma also includes its `document_frequency` (weighted
frequency of that lemma within the given document), or `null` if none is
recorded. `document_id` and `prior_word` (the preceding word in the text,
also beta code) also feed disambiguation: whichever candidate parse scores
highest once corpus-wide form frequency, in-document lemma frequency, and
prior-word bigram frequency are averaged together gets `is_winner: true`.

Example: looking up μῆνιν (`mh=nin`), the first word of the *Iliad*
(tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc2:1.1) -- document_id is whole-document only, so
the API has no notion of "line 1.1" beyond it being a word in that document:

```sh
curl -G "http://127.0.0.1:8000/morph" \
  --data-urlencode "word=mh=nin" \
  --data-urlencode "language=grc" \
  --data-urlencode "document_id=tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-grc2"
```
